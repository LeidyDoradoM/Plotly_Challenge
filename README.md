# Belly Button Biodiversity 

This week's project is all about plotting and designing a website that shows findings and insights about the bacteria world inside of our belly buttons.

## Overview:

The website shows three different plots:
 - Bar chart: Display at a time, the ten top bacterias that have been found in a specif subject.
 - Bubble chart: All the bacterias found in the same specific subject.
 - Gauge chart:  Shows the belly button washing frequency for each subject.

In addition, the web site is interactive such that the user could choose from a drop-menu a specific subject and each one of the plot-charts are updated with the information corresponding to the subject chosen.
